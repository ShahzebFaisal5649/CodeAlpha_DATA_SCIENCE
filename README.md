## Introduction

In this project, we explore several machine learning tasks using Python and relevant libraries. We leverage datasets ranging from Titanic passenger data to stock prices and insurance charges. Each task involves preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating predictions using appropriate metrics.

## Datasets Used

- **Titanic Dataset**: Analyzed survival probabilities based on passenger features.
- **Stock Prices Dataset**: Predicted stock prices using LSTM neural networks.
- **Insurance Charges Dataset**: Estimated medical charges based on demographic data using linear regression.

## Tasks and Techniques

### Task 1: Titanic Dataset Analysis

- **Objective**: Predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger characteristics.
- **Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing including missing value imputation and categorical variable encoding.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations using Altair and Matplotlib.
  - Implementation of Random Forest Classifier for survival prediction.
  - Evaluation of model performance using accuracy score and cross-tabulation.

### Task 2: Stock Prices Prediction with LSTM

- **Objective**: Forecast future stock prices using historical data.
- **Techniques**:
  - Time series data preprocessing and normalization.
  - LSTM model architecture setup using Keras.
  - Training and validation of the LSTM model.
  - Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.

### Task 3: Insurance Charges Prediction with Linear Regression

- **Objective**: Predict medical charges based on demographic factors.
- **Techniques**:
  - Linear regression modeling and interpretation.
  - Visualization of relationships using Altair and Matplotlib.
  - Model evaluation using R-squared score, coefficients, and MSE.
  - Predictions on new data and visualization of predicted charges.
